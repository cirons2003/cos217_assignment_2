What authorized sources of information did you use to complete the
assignment? COPY THE LIST of authorized sources of information given
in the "Policies" web page (also available on armlab in the file
~cos217/AuthorizedSourcesList ) to this section of the readme file,
and edit it as appropriate.

C Programming Book (mostly used this)
Lecture Slides

Ed Discussion

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What unauthorized sources of information did you use to complete the
assignment? List any unauthorized sources of information that you used
to complete the assignment, and describe how you used them. The course
"Policies" web page defines unauthorized sources of information, and
any source that you have used but not listed in the authorized sources
should be included here. Please note that using an unauthorized source
may trigger a course penalty, and depending on the nature of the
interaction, may additionally require the interaction being reported
to the Committee on Discipline. Write "None" if you used no
unauthorized sources of information.

None

This paper represents my own work in accordance with University
regulations.

What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful? Was it fun?

Yes, a bit tedious at times, but it was helpful in that it showed 
how to compose a module and compile multi file programs

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(optional) What information can you provide about your submission that
will help your grader to grade it in the most favorable light? In
particular, what bugs are in your submission?

Is it possible for Str_copy or Str_concat to call assert to verify
that the destination memory area specified by the caller is large
enough? Explain.

Based on my understanding of course material to this point and some 
exploring of the C textbook, I don't think there is a way to assert
whether the destination memory area is large enough. This is likely the
reason why the book warns us to be intentional with our usage of these 
functions since they are inherently unsafe. 

A better alternative is to use the variations of many string functions 
that have the n in the middle since those allow you to explicitly 
bound the space that the function can use. Still on us to make sure we
pass the correct value for n, but at least we need to think about it.

The reason for this I believe, is that the only information passed into
these functions is a pointer to the first character of the string. Any 
checking of the space must be done in linear time by finding the null 
character, and even if you traversed to the end of it, or past, there 
is no way to actually check if a memory address is available or in use. 

We could maybe use malloc, and realloc, but these would involve working 
with heap memory rather than the stack or data segments and would 
require that we change the location of the strings which violated the 
handshake of the string module in many cases.
